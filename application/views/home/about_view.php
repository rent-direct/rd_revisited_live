                            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                            <p>Rent Direct Online Ltd are a team of people, who were left disillusioned with the current set up of the letting industry. We include tenants and landlords from all sectors: residential, commercial, property share and holiday lets. Throughout our dealings with a selection of agents in our local areas, and also of online 'Pseudo' agents we were left time and again with a bad taste in our mouths. Constant let downs, misinformation-information, deliberate lies, and lost opportunities prompted us to try to change the market and provide a better service within the industry.</p>
                            <h2>Are we a letting agency?</h2>
                            <p>No, no and no again.</p>
                            <p>Rent Direct is a sophisticated web portal offering property marketing services to private landlords. It includes some ground breaking functionality to help landlords and tenants alike easily manage their interactions in an simple, and direct manner. Cutting out the need for agencies in its entirety, while allowing for full transparency between both parties.</p>
                            <h2>So you are against the agents?</h2>
                            <p>Not at all, we respect the vast majority who offer a true service and work hard for the benefits of their clients. It's the small minority who have given the group a bad name, and necessitated the need for Rent Direct. Read our page Why No Agents? for further explanations.</p>
                            <h2>Why should I use you to show my properties. Why not stick to companies like Right Move or Zoopla or agents?</h2>
                            <p>There are several reasons why we believe you should not use the afor mentioned companies</p>
                            <div class='list-container'>
                                <ul class='custom-list'>
                                    <li>By promoting your property yourself, you are offering a unique service, providing better contact with tenants, simplified letting system, and a complete departure from traditional agency led lettings.</li>
                                    <li>The existing search aggregates only allow agents or 'Pseudo' agents to place their properties on their sites, meaning your unique property is hidden amongst 300,000 agents properties, with no clue to the average visitor that you are offering a much better experience than an agent could</li>
                                    <li>We are not competing in the same market. RightMove and Zoopla both provide an online portal to display agents properties. Taking care of the market of people who like to use the agents services. We deal fully with private landlords and tenants who for reasons of their own would prefer direct contact with the landlords.</li>
                                    <li>Letting agents charge for their services, and traditionally have an ongoing charging commitment once a tenant is found</li>
                                </ul>

                            <h2>Costs</h2>
                            <p>Rather than charging huge upfront costs or a percentage of any rental income earned. Rent Direct has decided upon a new style of charging. One which offers full transparency and much better value to our clients.</p>
                            <p>For each property you want to list on the site, you will be charged £20.00 per month. This charge is only applicable while your property is listed. Meaning, should you rent your home in the first month, there will be no further charge. You will continue to have full access to all the tools and functionality of the site. Allowing you to utilise your Rent Direct dashboard to manage many aspects of your tenant / landlord interactions.</p>
                            <p>There are upgrade options if you wish to have prime placement of your listing i.e.. <b>HEADLINER, PREMIUM</b> (front page) or <b>FEATURED </b>(top of search results). These upgrade options carry an additional monthly charge. However. the standard listing includes photo upload, video, brochures, EPC certificates, street views, maps, descriptions and other features as standard*<br /><b> *(fair play policy in place. i.e.. don't try to add 1000 photos etc).</b></p>
                            <p>Additional services such as tenant credit checks are charged separately at highly discounted rates. </p>
                            <p>For all the functionality included in your individual account dashboard, including detailed statistics, instant messaging, historical data, and access to the rate / report and check database, there is no charge at all.</p>
                            <p><b>Tenants costs?</b> None, simply register for an account and have access to the full functionality and features of the site. To search for a property, you don't even need to set up an account.</p>
                            <h2>But what about ongoing costs, and commitments?</h2>
                            <p>Quite simply there are none. Your contact is between the landlord / tenant not Rent Direct. You will have contractual commitments within any agreements you have with them such as paying rent. But as far as Rent Direct is involved we are simply a very, very, very advanced search portal built just for you.</p>
